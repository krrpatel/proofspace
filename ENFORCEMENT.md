# ClaimSBT Enforcement & Strike Policy

This document describes how copyright and license violations are handled for the ClaimSBT repository.

## Purpose
To deter unauthorized copying and redistribution and to provide a clear, consistent process for enforcement.

## Strike System
A violating party will receive "strikes" as follows:

- Strike 1 — Notice & Takedown Request
  - We send a formal notice and request removal of the infringing content from public hosting and distribution channels.
  - We log the incident and notify the infringing party.
  - If the content is removed within 7 calendar days, the matter is considered resolved (no further action).

- Strike 2 — Platform Reporting
  - If the content is not removed, we submit DMCA/host takedown requests and platform abuse reports (GitHub, GitLab, npm, package registries, hosting providers).
  - We may notify the infringing party again and request confirmation of compliance.

- Strike 3 — Legal Escalation
  - If the infringement persists, we reserve the right to pursue civil remedies, including injunctive relief and monetary damages, and to recover enforcement costs (e.g., attorneys' fees).
  - We may also seek account suspension on platforms using available reporting channels.

## Evidence & Documentation
Before any takedown/report, we collect:
- Proof of original authorship (commits, timestamps, source files).
- Evidence of copying or reuse (URL snapshots, manifests, code comparisons).
- Any relevant communications.

## Takedown Template
Use the DMCA_Takedown_Template.txt supplied with the repository to notify providers or platforms.

## Exceptions & Licensing
If you believe your use is permitted (e.g., you have a license or permission), contact us immediately with proof (signed license, email confirmation).

## Contact
To resolve or request a license:
- Email: krpa020@gmail.com
- Please include: infringing URL(s), your contact info, and any proof of permission.
